The Udemy Pro Shop is a project I made following along Brad Traversy's tutorial on an e-commerce MERN app found in https://www.udemy.com/share/103Cb6AEIfcVZSRHkB/.

The app is a mock e-commerce website where you are able to "purchase" various gadgets. Users are able to: 
- Create/edit their account and view their order history
- Browse or search the website for items
- Purchase items using the PayPal SDK
- Leave reviews for items

Created accounts can also have admin privileges. Admins are able to:
- Delete/edit other accounts
- Create/edit/delete products
- Process orders
