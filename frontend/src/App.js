export default App

// changed App to arrow function per Brad's preference
// deleted entire div that was here from create react app boiler plate
// deleted initial .git folder using command "rm -rf .git". wants git repository in root, not in frontend
// move .gitignore into root
// added "node_modules/" into gitignore because all node modules are going to be in root, which is all of our server dependecies
// added .env to gitignore, too
